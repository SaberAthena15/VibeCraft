## 4. In-depth explanation of the project

The application is a Next.js project. The user starts on the homepage (`app/page.js`), where they can enter a prompt describing the web application they want to create. The `Hero.jsx` component handles the user input and the initial prompt enhancement.

When the user submits a prompt, a new workspace is created in the Convex database, and the user is redirected to the workspace page (`app/(main)/workspace/[id]/page.jsx`). The workspace page is divided into two main sections: a `ChatView` and a `CodeView`.

The `ChatView.jsx` component displays the conversation between the user and the AI. When the user sends a message, it's saved to the Convex database, and a request is sent to the `/api/ai-chat/route.jsx` API route. This route uses the Google Generative AI to get a response from the AI and then updates the conversation in the database.

The `CodeView.jsx` component displays the generated code. When a new message is added to the chat, a request is sent to the `/api/gen-ai-code/route.jsx` API route. This route uses the Google Generative AI to generate the code based on the conversation history and then updates the files in the Convex database. The `CodeView` component uses the Sandpack library to display the code editor and a live preview of the application.

The application uses Convex to store the chat history and the generated files for each workspace. The `convex/workspace.js` file defines the mutations and queries for interacting with the `workspace` table in the database.

## 10. The Role of AI in VibeCraft

The AI, powered by Google's Gemini model, is the core of VibeCraft. It plays two key roles in the application: **Prompt Enhancement** and **Code Generation**.

### Prompt Enhancement

When a user enters a prompt, they have the option to "enhance" it. This feature is handled by the `/api/enhance-prompt/route.jsx` API route. It sends the user's prompt to the Gemini model with a specific set of instructions (defined in `data/Prompt.jsx` as `ENHANCE_PROMPT_RULES`) to make the prompt more specific, detailed, and better suited for code generation. This helps to improve the quality of the generated code by providing the AI with a clearer and more detailed set of requirements.

### Code Generation

The main feature of VibeCraft is its ability to generate code from a text prompt. This is handled by the `/api/gen-ai-code/route.jsx` API route. When the user sends a message in the chat, the entire conversation history is sent to the Gemini model along with a detailed prompt (defined in `data/Prompt.jsx` as `CODE_GEN_PROMPT`) that instructs the AI to generate a React project using Vite and Tailwind CSS.

The AI is instructed to return the generated code in a specific JSON format, which includes the project title, an explanation of the project, a list of the generated files, and the code for each file. The `CodeView.jsx` component then parses this JSON response and displays the generated files in the Sandpack code editor and preview.
